# Multi-Label Predictions on Academic Articles
## Project Overview
This repository contains the code and resources for the project "Multi-Label Predictions on Academic Articles". The primary objective of this project is to classify research papers into multiple labels (e.g., Computer Science, Physics, Mathematics, etc.) using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The project explores various models and algorithms to achieve robust multi-label classification.
